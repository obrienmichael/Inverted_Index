Eric Pryz Wiki

In 2009, Prydz released "Miami to Atlanta", which is when the Pryda snare was first used.
The Pryda snare is a popular technique in house and trance music consisting of using a
compressed and sustained snare sample at the end of a bar. Commonly used to mark progressions in a
song structure, many consider it to be one of the most sampled sounds in the electronic dance music
world, which is notably used by producers such as Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, and W&W.[15]
